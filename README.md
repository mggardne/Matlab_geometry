# Matlab_MRI_knee_geometry
Matlab code for analyzing MRI knee geometry

This is a collection of Matlab functions for converting Osirix/Horos regions of interest (ROIs) comma separated values (CSV) files
using the polygon digitizing tool on MRI images into triangular surface meshes.  Note that the functions require a specific naming
convention for the ROIs.

The emphasis of this project is quantitfying the geometry of the knee.  There are function for getting bone based coordinate
systems.  Besides quantifying the geometry, there are functions for calculating cartilage thicknesses.

 See Matlab function file header comments for more information.
